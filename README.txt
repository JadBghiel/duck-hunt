TO ASK:
- does the command have to be exaclty ./my_hunter (currently ./my_hunter
and anything more works too)


KNOWN ISSUES:
- the sprite sheet appears for a short moment in the top left corner everytime
    the birds dies
- cant kill when not in fullscreen
- memory leaks: need to free amap


TODO:
- game over
- death animation
- implement score of the player
- all time high score
- sounds
- diff levels: 3 levels, slow, medium, fast 
- small target under the mouse cursor

- The program must contain moving (rotating, translating, or scaling) elements.
- The program must accept the “-h” option, then display a short description of the
program, and the available user inputs.
- Your window should stick between 800x600 pixels and 1920x1080 pixels. : add a scale
handling in the create sprite function
