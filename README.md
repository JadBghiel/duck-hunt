## Innerworkings

### Proyect structure

#### Approach

For this project, I started by setting up the game window and rendering the main elements, including the bird and background. I then implemented sprite animations and user interactions, allowing the bird to be "shot" when clicked. To enhance the experience, I added a soundtrack and sound effects, ensuring smooth playback.

#### Tools

The only allowed functions of this project were the CSFML and math library ones as well as some standard C functions : malloc, free, memset, rand, srand, time (only with srand), (f)open ,(f)read, (f)write, (f)close, getline.

The rest were all custom made functions.
